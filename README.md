# hello-world

My first tiny steps as a GitHub noob

I am an engineer (mechanical/materials science) with interests in robotics, design, artificial intelligence, languages (human and 
computer), computer graphics/modeling/simulation, microkernel operating systems, user interfaces, sustainable design, generative 
design, architecture, additive manufacturing, CAD/CAM, and math.  Especially math.
